This repository demonstrates a common error in Python related to handling empty lists and lists containing non-numeric elements in calculations. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` offers a corrected version. The error arises when attempting to calculate the average of an empty list or a list with non-numeric elements (such as strings).  The solution involves robust error handling and type checking to prevent unexpected behavior.
